Hello my name is Alex Ngui Kingoo and this is my project ;

1.PROJECT TITLE: ONLINE BUS BOOKING SYSTEM Designing.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:The bus booking system aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to book bus tickets. The system will be designed as a web or mobile application where users can search for available buses, view schedules and routes, select seats, and make secure online payments. The project will focus on creating a user-friendly interface and a robust backend system to handle bookings and ticket generation.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:The app addresses the inconvenience faced by users when booking bus tickets manually or through traditional methods. It eliminates the need for users to physically visit bus stations or rely on phone bookings, saving time and effort. The app aims to streamline the booking process, offer real-time information on bus availability, and provide a secure payment gateway, enhancing the overall user experience.

IN SCOPE FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:
1.User registration and login system
2.Search and filtering options for buses based on routes, dates, and fares
3.Display of available bus schedules, seat availability, and fares
4.Selection of seats and seat reservation
5.Integration of secure online payment options
6.Generation of e-tickets with unique identifiers
7.Email/SMS notifications for booking confirmation and reminders
8.User profile management for viewing past bookings and personal information updates
9.Admin panel for managing bus routes, schedules, fares, and user accounts

RISKS:
a. COMPETATION SABOTAGING: There may be existing bus booking systems in the market, and competitors may try to sabotage my project by offering aggressive discounts or other strategies. To mitigate this risk,I will focus on providing excellent service, competitive fares, and additional features that differentiate my app.
b. USER RESISTANCE: Some users may be hesitant to adopt a new booking system if they are accustomed to traditional methods. To address this,I will provide clear benefits, offer a user-friendly interface, and provide customer support to assist users in transitioning to the new system.
c. INTERNET ACCESS COST: Internet access can be costly for users, especially in certain regions. I will optimize my app to work on low-bandwidth connections, offer offline capabilities where possible, and explore partnerships with local network providers to provide affordable data packages.
